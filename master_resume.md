## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### **Reliability & Quality Engineer**

**Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (YMTC)** | *Wuhan, China* | *June 2021 – April 2024*

#### **Phase 1: Failure Analysis & Lab Operations (Lab / QC Focus)**

In Failure Analysis reverse engineering group. Focused on NAND structure for half a year as new-hire. Delayer every layer of NAND operating polish machine and take picture by SEM.

* **Microscopy & Inspection:** Operated **SEM** and **FIB** daily to inspect nanometer-level defects in 3D NAND Flash stacks. Identified failure mechanisms (shorts, voids, contamination) using high-resolution imaging and non-destructive **X-Ray** analysis.
* **Chemical Sample Prep:** Performed complex **chemical decapsulation** using Hydrofluoric and Sulfuric acid to expose silicon dies. Executed precision cross-sectioning and polishing of multi-layer chips for physical analysis.
* **Competitor Analysis:** Conducted physical tear-downs and reverse engineering of competitor products (e.g., Marvell, Micron). Analyzed **PCB soldering quality** (SMT/NSMT) and measured copper layer thickness via delayering.
* **LIMS:** Use LIMS to record and track different experimental processes, submit 1 case report every week with 10+ test procedures.

#### **Phase 2: Reliability Engineering & Test Automation (Engineering Focus)**

Change position to Reliability test group in the same department (Q&R). Pivot into electricity performance. Learned how to operate Teredyne MagnumV ATE. Learned how to write NAND firmware test program. Similar job responsibility like FT, but in different stage and deapartment, so we refernce their code but have to develope our own. Sometimes they use different ATE to cross check.
Collaborate with a collegue to develop new SRAM DC/Functiona Test by scratch, thus know the MagnumV more and know how to design test program by product spec. Know how to use oscilloscope to catch signal and debug. Finished the whole set of code in 6 months and deliver to product team. They are in charge of contacting a outsource test company for large-scale burn-in test (MagnumV is too high-end and high cost for this scenario). Tested 400+ chips every stage and sent to third-party to verify their results. Bussiness trip to Shanghai to see their test enviroment and make sure the validation phase went on succesfully.After that because I'm so familiar with the ATE, and we got a new product line for eMMC, I checked the old script from FT team and decided they're too outdated and no longer suitable for new product. I re-design the whole test using new structure and features in MagnumV. Enhance the error debug procedure, for example before when write/read fail the old script could only get F result. But I made it output which section fail and we can see the result in External RAM in MagnumV, greatly enhanced our error debug ability. And I also made the whole process from 2hr to 1hr running time with greater coverage. I work as a core tech member and collaborate with Controller Vendor to add firmware update function and so on. I found the debugged 20+ early state JIRA issues. Some bugs are found by me using python to anaylize log data, some logs are larger than 100MB. After the product pass the verification stage, I already handled 2000+ samples. At the end of year, I got the 5/5 performance review in the group and that's 25% annual salary reward.
During that period, I was a workholic. I sometimes got off work after 10pm because I kept debugging and thinking non-stop.
I resigned the job because my husband graduated as PHD from the same school as me. And we all agreed he should persue in academic field.So he got a postdoc position in the US and I relocated with him. Everyone was surprised at that time.

* **Test Automation (C++/Python):** Developed automated test scripts on **Magnum 5 (Teradyne)** for NAND Flash validation. Wrote **Python** scripts to parse logs and extract KPIs, **reducing data analysis time by 50%**.
* **Framework Development:** Spearheaded the creation of a new **SRAM** testing framework from scratch, implementing Read/Write disturb and retention tests based on product specs.
* **System Validation:** Validated **eSSD** and Firmware protocols (HTOL). Debugged system failures using **Oscilloscopes** and logic analyzers to reproduce bugs.
* **Lab Management:** Managed 1000+ chips sample intake and coordinated with technicians to ensure a **24-hour turnaround** for urgent requests. Maintained 100% inventory traceability for sensitive prototypes.
* **Top Performance:** Achieved **Top Performance Rating (5/5)**, ranking in the **top 1%** of the department for exceptional adaptability and technical delivery.

### **Volunteer**

**Literacy Volunteers of Greater Worcester** | *Worcester, MA* | *Dec 204 – Now*

After I came to the US, the first thing I do is to find free-English learning resources. Even though I passed the TOFEL with 100 score, I knew my speaking is not good enough to land a similar job as before for me. So I attended the English class in LVGW. After the first semester passed, they held a potluck party for us, thus I got to knew the director, Ping. Ping is a Chinese woman and she needed some volunteers to handle some legacy documents into digital format. She invited me to be a volunteer so I accepted gladly, and then she enrolled me in a small group English group for higher level training.
At first I was helping to scan every tutor's document, and put them into google drive by tutor's name. And then Ping asked me if I could helped her with the old website, she knew the website was using WordPress but she didn't know how to fix some trivial bugs such as some picture will be duplicate as feature image and post image. I learned WordPress by myself and using custom CSS feature fixed all bugs she mentioned. I even made a modern website for LVGW, but Ping said she thinks it's better to stay as the old one because people are familiar with the old one. But later this year she introduced me to a Chinese School and I helped them designed a new website using WordPress. During this period, I also helped students registration before every semester. Because of this, I know how to help people who has little English.
